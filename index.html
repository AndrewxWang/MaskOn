            <p>Are you a teacher who is tired of their students pulling down their masks during class? Well, look no further. Introducing Mask On, a disciplinary program that trains students to keep their masks on throughout their school day.
            </p>
            <p>In order to maintain a safe learning environment during the pandemic, Students should always wear their masks, especially in classrooms and confined spaces. The exception to this, however, is during lunch periods and gym/physical activity.

        <p>Introducing the MDL, motion detection lights that detect when students attempt to remove their masks. By signing up to our program, you will receive up to 30 MDLs that are easily attachable to masks and access to an admin console that manages
            the sensors. These lights will detect when students attempt to pull off their masks during class. If the sensor reaches a certain threshold, the light will turn red and begin to flash indicating that a mask was removed.
        </p>
        <p>Don't worry! The MDL can be disabled during their lunch and gym periods. Be sure to read through our instruction manual on how to manage these lights, their motion sensitivity, and activity time through the admin console.
