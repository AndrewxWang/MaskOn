            <p>Are you a teacher who is tired of their students pulling down their masks during class? Well, look no
                further! <br> Introducing Mask On, a disciplinary program that trains students to keep their masks on
                throughout their school day.
            </p>
            <p>In order to maintain a safe learning environment during the pandemic, Students should always wear their
                masks, especially in classrooms and confined spaces. The exception to this, however, is during lunch
                periods and gym/physical activity.

            <p>Introducing the MDL, motion detection lights that detect when students attempt to remove their masks. By
                signing up to our program, you will receive up to 30 MDLs that are easily attachable to masks and access to
                an admin console that manages
                the sensors. These lights will detect when students attempt to pull off their masks during class. If the
                sensor reaches a certain threshold, the light will turn red and begin to flash indicating that a mask was
                removed.
            </p>
            <p>Don't worry! The MDL can be disabled during their lunch and gym periods. Be sure to read through our
                instruction manual on how to manage these lights, their motion sensitivity, and activity time through the
                admin console.

            <p>Students will be trained through positive reinforcement and positive punishment.</p>
            <p>Positive reinforcement is when the person or animal is presented with a positive stimulus in order to
                strengthen behavior. At the end of the day, if the student's motion sensor does not detect their mask
                being removed during their school day, students will be rewarded a point. These points can be managed
                through your admin console. By accumulating points, students can choose to be rewarded with various
                rewards such as a homework pass, a piece of candy, etc.
