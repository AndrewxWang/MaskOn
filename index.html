            <p>Are you a teacher who is tired of their students pulling down their masks during class? Well, look no
                further.
                <br> Introducing Mask On, a disciplinary program that trains students to keep their masks on throughout
                their school day. Studies have shown that wearing masks inside and maintaining a six feet distance
                lowers COVID-19 rates by 90% (made-up statistic). In order to maintain a safe learning environment
                during the pandemic, students should always wear their masks while inside, especially in classrooms and
                confined spaces. The exception to this rule is during lunch periods and gym/physical activity.

            </p>
            <p>
                Students will be trained through a process called Operant Conditioning. Operant conditioning is a
                learning process in which behavior is strengthened or diminished through a reinforcer or punisher. Our
                program uses both of these in a token economy, a system in which behavior is reinforced with “points”
                which can be exchanged for rewards.

            <p>Introducing the <font color="#6495ED">
                    <font color="6495ED">MDL</font>,
                </font> motion detection lights that detect when students attempt to remove their masks. By
                signing up to our program, you will receive up to 30 <font color="6495ED">MDLs</font> that are easily
                attachable to masks and access
                to an admin console that manages the sensors. These lights will detect when students attempt to pull off
                their masks during class. If the sensor reaches a certain threshold, the light will turn red and begin
                to flash indicating that a mask was removed. See the visual animation above for further demonstration
                of how the <font color="6495ED">MDLs</font> work.
            </p>
            <p>While outside the classroom or during periods where students are allowed to take their masks off, do not
                worry! The <font color="6495ED">MDL</font> can be disabled by an administrator (teacher) during
                students’ lunch and gym periods. Be
                sure to read through our instruction manual when you receive the <font color="6495ED">MDLs</font> on how
                to manage these lights,
                their motion sensitivity, and activity time through the admin console.

            <p>Students will be trained through positive reinforcement and positive punishment.</p>
            <p>Positive reinforcement is when the person or animal is presented with a positive stimulus in order to
                strengthen behavior. At the end of the day, if the student's motion sensor does not detect their mask
                being removed during their school day, students will be rewarded an <font color="#2eb82e">On Point.
                </font> These points can be managed through your admin console. By accumulating points, students can
                choose to be rewarded with various rewards such as a homework pass, a piece of candy, etc.
            </p>
            <p>Positive punishment will also be used in this program. Positive punishment is when a person or animal
                receives something usually unpleasant to reduce their behavior. Every time a student removes their mask,
                they receive an <font color="#cc0000">Off Point.</font> After receiving 3 <font color="#cc0000">Off
                    Points</font>, the student will have to stay after school
                for detention. Further infractions will result in more consequences decided by school authorities.
            </p>
            <p>
                <font color="#2eb82e">On Points</font> will be reinforced through a fixed-interval schedule. A
                fixed-interval schedule is when a person or animal receives the reinforcement or punishment at a
                specified amount of
                time. Our program distributes the reinforcer on a fixed-interval as students receive their point at the
                end of the day at the same time every day. 
            </p>
            <p>On the other hand, <font color="#cc0000">Off Points</font> will be distributed on a fixed-ratio schedule.
                A fixed-ratio schedule is when a person or animal receives reinforcement or punishment after a specified
                number of times. In our program, students receive a detention after 3 <font color="#cc0000">Off Points,
                </font> which is a constant number.</p>

            <p>Since our <font color="6495ED">MDLs</font> are attached on to masks with a light that changes as motion
                is detected, students are
                already aware of the connection between the light and pulling down their masks, making acquisition
                established. With almost instant reinforcement and punishment with the help of our <font color="6495ED">
                    MDLs,</font> it is evident
                that our method
                of training is one of the best compared to our competitors. Furthermore, a token economy is beneficial
                in our training method as it motivates the students to keep their masks on for rewards and to avoid
                punishments.
